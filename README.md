DOTFILES
========

In this repository you can find my dotfiles.

The way in which I recommend working, if you want to use my dotfiles out of the box is

```
cd ~/Documents/Stuff
git clone https://www.github.com/acamps/dotfiles.git
cd
ln -s Documents/Stuff/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s Documents/Stuff/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

And for the time being, this is it, since I'm not using any more dotfile that I care enought to share.
